S-749:  . . .
S-749:  W-What...?
???:    Welcome to the Time Keeper Complex again.
S-749:  What? Who is talking? Where are you?
???:    My name is Emil. I'm the AI in charge of this place.
S-749:  Where am I? What is this place?
Emil:   This is the Time Keeper Complex. A place where you can "travel into the future".
S-749:  What?
Emil:   You came here long time ago asking for the services Time Keeper Society offered back then.
S-749:  Time Keeper Society?
Emil:   Yes, they were the ones who built this Complex in where we are right now. They offered many more services to people
        back then, one of them being traveling in time.
S-749:  Oh... so I guess I did used some of those services...
Emil:   Yes, the "Forwarding Time" service. Basically, what it does is take you in a ship, like the one we are right now,
        close to a black hole to orbit it. Due to the density of the black hole, the space-time is contracted around it,
        making the time run 'slower' for us than it does to people on earth. So, technically, we are traveling in time.
S-749:  ... okay, I don't remember anything of this and I feel dizzy.
Emil:   It's completely normal, you have been sleeping for 143 years. Memories will come back to you eventually, don't worry.
S-749:  What? What year is this?
Emil:   2487. Having in mind time passes 3 times faster for us here, that'll be 429 years, adding that to the current
        year on earth, it will be 2916 when you get back to earth.
S-749:  It means that I fell asleep here in 2344.
Emil:   Correct.
S-749:  I hope I star to remember everything soon, because I feel really lost. Actually I remember something: I was supposed
        to sleep 150 years. Why did you wake me up then?
Emil:   Something hit the ship and damaged some of the Oxygen Generating System, so the Oxygen levels are decreasing slowly.
        We need to get back.
S-749:  WHAT!? How much time do we have!?
Emil:   At this rate, 3 years.
S-749:  Oh god. Is there a way to repair the Oxygen Generator?
Emil:   To fix it completely, no, but we can add a couple more years to it.
S-749:  How?
Emil:   We need the manuals, tools and the equipment.
S-749:  Alright, let's get hands to work.

S-749:  Let's go left.
. . .
Emil:   Hmm... This seems to be a control room for the capsules out there.
S-749:  Yeah, I think the same. By the way, are those capsules empty?
Emil:   Yes, I can't recognize any other life beeing but you. The whole place could be empty.
S-749:  Damn. Where did they all go?
Emil:
