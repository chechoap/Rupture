***** intro *****

???:    Hey, wake up! We need to go.
S-749:  . . .
??:     Hey, are you okay? Hurry up, we need to move now!
S-749:  W-What...? Where am I?
???:    I'll explain you later, come on, move!
S-749:  What? Who is talking? Where are you?
???:    *Sighs* I'm in your head, you don't remember anything, do you? My name is Emil, and AI implanted in your brain.
S-749:  I'm confused... I don't remember you or... anything about this place. Where are we?
Emil:   We need to move, I'll tell you more soon, but for now we need to leave this place. Hurry up, get on your feet
        and start walking.
S-749:  Alright... Where do I go?
Emil:   Let me map the room... Okay, we have two choices: go left or go right, both ways seem safe according to my
        mapping.
S-749:  Okay... so... tell me where to go.
Emil:   Well, if we go right, we get deeper into the first floor, if we go left, we access the stairs to the second
        floor. The door in front of us seems locked. I'll recommend going into the first floor, maybe we can find the
        exit.
S-749:  You don't know where the exit is? What happened to your "mapping"?
Emil:   This is a place neither you nor I know so my mapping can't show us the entire place. We need to move to create
        a virtual map. I'm as lost as you are.
S-749:  I'm getting scared... And I feel... weird, tired.
Emil:   You've been sleeping for about 1500 years, it's logical that you feel tired.
S-749:  WHAT!?
Emil:   Please! Move! We can't stay here much longer, the radiation levels are increasing extremely fast. Move!

***** control room *****

** 1 **

S-749:  Let's go left, upstairs.

. . .

Emil:   This seems to be a control room, but I don't get any signals from it, no electric power either.
S-749:  Yeah, I see all this equipment... Is this what controles all those capsules out there?
Emil:   Probably this controls everything in this place.
S-749:  Everything?
Emil:   Yes, don't you think there's more to this place than just these rooms?
S-749:  You tell me!
Emil:   Okay, okay. Chill. Let's see if we can find some information about this place in this room.
S-749:  Is there a way that we can turn this computers on? Surely we can find some information in it.
Emil:   Maybe, but firt we need to give power to this machines.
S-749:  Alright, let's go the other way then. We can't do much here by now.
