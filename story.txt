S-749:  . . .
S-749:  W-What...?
???:    Welcome to the Time Keeper Complex again.
S-749:  What?
???:    My name is Emil. I'm the AI in charge of this place.
S-749:  Where am I? What is this place?
Emil:   This is the Time Keeper Complex, you don't remember, do you?
S-749:  Uh... No...
Emil:   You came into this spaceship because you wanted to travel in time.
S-749:  Travel in time?
Emil:   Yeah. Long ago you came to the Time Keeper Society because you wanted to travel in time, so, here you are.
S-749:  Oh... I'm starting to remember... I think we are orbiting a black hole, right?
Emil:   Yes. Due to the density of the black hole, the space-time is contracted around it,
        making the time run 'slower' for us than it does to people on earth. So, technically, we are traveling in time.
S-749:  Yeah... I remember some of that. God, I feel really dizzy.
Emil:   It's completely normal, you have been sleeping for 143 years. Memories will come back to you eventually, don't worry.
S-749:  What year is this?
Emil:   2487. Time passes 3 times faster for us here, so that'll be 429 years, adding that to the current
        year on earth, it will be 2916 when you get back to earth.
S-749:  It means that I fell asleep here in 2344.
Emil:   Correct. You were supposed to sleep 150 years but something hit the spaceship and damaged part of the Oxygen
        Generating System. We are losing oxygen at a constant rate, so I had to wake you up, we need to repair it.
S-749:  How much oxygen do we have left?
Emil:   Around 2 or 3 years. It could be less if we don't move fast enough.
S-749:  Oh God... And how do we repair it?
Emil:   We need the manuals from the archives, also the tools and the equipment.
S-749:  Well, guide me through, there's no time to waste.

*Decisions are important in this game. It'll affect the behaviors of some characters, the trust they have in you and may

***** left *****
S-749:  Let's go left.
. . .
Emil:   Are you feeling okay?
S-749:  Yes, just a little dizzy but it's okay.
Emil:   Alright. We need to hurry up. You still have plenty oxygen left but at this rate it won't last enough to make it back
        to earth.
S-749:  How much time does it take to go back to earth from here?
Emil:   Around 1.4 light years.
S-749:  How fast does this ship go?
Emil:   30% of light speed, around 4.66 years to get there.
S-349:  Is the oxygen enough to travel that distance?
Emil:   If we don't repair the OGS, no. We're losing oxygen at a constant rate, we need to fix it.
S--749: Okay, and how do we do that?
Emil:   Well
